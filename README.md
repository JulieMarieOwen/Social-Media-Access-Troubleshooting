<h1>Help Desk Ticket: Social Media Access Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A user had the following issue:<br>
I can't seem to reach Facebook—the Edge browser says, "Hmmm… can't reach this page. Moved permanently to a new web address.
ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID."
Other websites are working fine.

<h2>Troubleshooting Process</h2>

- <b>Theory 1: Browser cache/Cookie issue: I cleared all browsing data and cookies, but that did not fix the issue</b>

- <b>Theory 2: It is being blocked by the Firewall: I disabled the Firewall temporarily and this did not allow me to access Facebook on Microsoft Edge</b>

- <b>Theory 3: Browser Issue: I installed Google Chrome and went to facebook.com – it is not accessible from Google Chrome</b>

- <b>Theory 4: Facebook is blocked by the Hosts file: I opened notepad as the administrator, navigated to the hosts file, opened it, and found that facebook.com is blocked due to company policy; I did not remove it as employees are obviously not meant to access Facebook on their work computer</b>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

- <b> Resolution (Internal): The reason Facebook isn’t accessible is because the company has the website blocked in the Hosts file; I did not remove the block since it was purposely blocked as a part of company policy.
- <b> Resolution (Client-Facing): The company has blocked your computer from being able to access Facebook.com because using that site on your computer is against company policy.  You will need to check with your manager to see if an exception should be made for your position.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
